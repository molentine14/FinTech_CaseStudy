# HW1_FinTech_CaseStudy_Figure
# Figure Technologies, Inc.
* ### Founded in December of 2018
* ### Raised $120 million in funding after only one year of operation
* ### Founded by Mike Cagney (who also founded SoFi but left after allegations of sexual harassment and company culture issues)
* ### Employs blockchain to gain competitive advantage on a less tech enabled industry landscape

## What is it
* Figure is a company currently disrupting the HELOC, mortgage refinance, and student loan refinance spaces Figure uses blockchain to manage their application process and data management as opposed to man power and dated data management tools at competitor firms.

### Bloomberg Description
    "Figure Technologies, Inc. operates as a financial technology company in both the home equity and blockchain space. The Company offers consumer financial solutions for home improvement, debt consolidation, and retirement. Figure Technologies serves customers in the United States."

## Why Figure Matters
* The use of blockchain and other technology has cut down on the processing time of loans and the time it takes to get a borrower their new refinanced loan terms by a truly disruptive amount.

    * Typical mortgage lenders take days to respond to applications and on average over a month to close on the refinancing of a loan. Figure has cut down the application time to minutes, with an automated verification of assets and income information as opposed to manual entry (finding and sending in relevant documents via pdf or fax), and the time to close to days.
    * Typical student loan refinancing providers are similarly uncompetitive with Figure in their application and loan processing times. With an application process as clunky as the mortgage lenders, Figure has implemented all of the same automated verification and application features that their mortgage product has to make applications much easier for borrowers, requiring minutes, not days and loan officers (employees) to complete. The typical closing time on a student loan refinancing is five days at Figure as opposed to weeks at traditional lenders.


### Product Descriptions
* HELOC (Home Equity Line of Credit) - Loans provided to home owners structured with and collateralized by the equity in an owner's home

* Mortgage Refinancing - A process home owners can employ when the current interest rate environment becomes more favorable than when they received their original loan terms, causing mortgage rates to drop below the rate the home owner is paying on their mortgage

* Student Loan Refinancing - Similar to mortgages, the interest rate environment dictates rates on student loans. Similar to a home owner with an uncompetitive mortgage interest rate, a student may refinance their student loans or package outstanding loans together (many students have more than one student loan) to get a lower interest rate on the aggregated debt

### Effective Marketing
* Figure employs an effective, and in my opinion necessary, marketing strategy to ensure borrowers understand and trust the very technology that provides Figure an advantage. In a time when blockchain and cryptocurrency are still often used in the same sentence, it can be hard to differentiate the two if you don't have the prerequisite information to do so. In an effort to avoid some of the feelings of volatility, illegality, and uncertainty associated with bitcoin and its history, Figure has created an informational video differentiating blockchain from bitcoin and showing how they use blockchain to improve the experience of the borrower and the security and efficiency of the loan process. It also includes a high level and concise description of how blockchain operates in the Figure context, dispelling some of the feelings of mistrust that can arise from misunderstanding or total lack of understanding.
